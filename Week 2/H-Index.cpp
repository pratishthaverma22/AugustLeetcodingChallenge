/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& c) {
        // 3 support variables for us
        int s = 0, e = c.size() - 1, avg;
        // the base of every happy binary search ever: having a sorted dataset
        sort(begin(c), end(c));
        // some good old binary search here to find the maximum element meeting the conditions
        while (s <= e) {
            if (c[avg = (e + s) / 2] < c.size() - avg) s = avg + 1;
            else e = avg - 1;
        }
        return c.size() - s;
    }
};
